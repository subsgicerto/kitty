In this article, we will show you how to use Pepakura Designer to create your own papercraft models. We will also share some tips and tricks to make your models more realistic and durable.
 
## How to Use Pepakura Designer
 
To use Pepakura Designer, you need to have a 3D model that you want to turn into a papercraft model. You can either create your own 3D model using a 3D modeling software, or download one from the internet. There are many websites that offer free 3D models for various purposes, such as [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/), [CGTrader](https://www.cgtrader.com/), and [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/).
 
Once you have your 3D model, you can open it in Pepakura Designer by clicking on the File menu and selecting Open. You can also drag and drop the file onto the Pepakura Designer window. Pepakura Designer supports a wide range of 3D file formats, such as .obj, .stl, .dae, .3ds, .lwo, .kmz, and more. If your file format is not supported, you can try converting it using an online converter, such as [AnyConv](https://anyconv.com/).
 
After opening your 3D model in Pepakura Designer, you will see two windows: the 3D window on the left and the 2D window on the right. The 3D window shows your model in its original shape and texture. The 2D window shows the unfolded pattern of your model that you can print and cut out.
 
You can use the toolbar at the top of the Pepakura Designer window to edit your 3D model or your 2D pattern. For example, you can use the Move tool to move your model or pattern around. You can use the Rotate tool to rotate your model or pattern in any direction. You can use the Join/Disjoin Faces tool to connect or disconnect faces of your model or pattern. You can use the Add Flaps tool to add flaps to your pattern that will help you glue the pieces together.
 
You can also use the menu bar at the top of the Pepakura Designer window to access more options and settings. For example, you can use the Settings menu to change the paper size, scale factor, line style, texture settings, and more. You can use the View menu to change the view mode of your 3D model or 2D pattern. You can use the Help menu to access the user manual, tutorials, and online support.
 
## How to Print and Assemble Your Papercraft Model
 
Once you are satisfied with your 2D pattern in Pepakura Designer, you can print it out using your printer. To do so, click on the File menu and select Print Preview. You will see a preview of how your pattern will look like on paper. You can adjust the number of pages, margins, orientation, and other settings before printing.
 
After printing out your pattern, you will need to cut out the pieces using scissors or a craft knife. Be careful not to cut along the dashed lines or fold lines. These lines indicate where you need to fold or glue the pieces together.
 
To assemble your papercraft model, you will need some glue and a ruler or a bone folder. You can use any type of glue that works well with paper, such as white glue, glue stick, or hot glue gun. You can use a ruler or a bone folder to help you make crisp and accurate folds along the fold lines.
